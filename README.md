## :book: About the project
Yahtzee is a dice game that is played with five 6-sided dice. Dice are rolled one at a time, with different combinations earning varying amounts of points. Players take turns rolling three dice three times each, with the option of reserving any number of dice between rolls. This is a simple terminal game written in the Python language.
